Kubeflow currently doesn't have a specific guide for NVIDIA Triton Inference 
Server. Note that Triton was previously known as the TensorRT Inference Server.
See the [NVIDIA
documentation](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/tree/main/deploy)
for instructions on running NVIDIA inference server on Kubernetes.
